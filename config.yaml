# Operating mode:
#   - "firstonline": Select the first 2 online DNS servers from the list and configure /etc/resolv.conf
#   - "benchmark": Test latency and update /etc/resolv.conf with the 2 fastest DNS servers
mode: benchmark

# Execution interval (in seconds)
# The program will execute the configured mode at this interval:
#   - In "firstonline" mode: checks DNS health and updates /etc/resolv.conf
#   - In "benchmark" mode: measures latency and updates /etc/resolv.conf with fastest servers
# Recommended values:
#   - firstonline mode: 300 (5 minutes) - frequent health checks
#   - benchmark mode: 900 (15 minutes) - less frequent but more comprehensive tests
execution_interval_seconds: 120

# DNS query timeout (in seconds)
# Default: 2
# How long to wait for a DNS response before considering it offline
timeout_seconds: 2

# Path to the resolv.conf file (optional)
# Default: /etc/resolv.conf
# You can change it for testing: /tmp/resolv.conf
resolv_conf_path: "/etc/resolv.conf"
